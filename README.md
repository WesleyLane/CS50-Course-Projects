# CS50-Course-Projects
This is a repo filled with all the small projects I will create throughout my CS50 online course. 

PROJECT 1:
  For projecct one I created a small game in scratch where you play as a rocketship trying to avoid the falling astroids. The game progresses and gets faster and faster overtime.
